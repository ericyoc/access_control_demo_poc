| Access Control Matrix          | Alice can read file2; Bob can  | Defines access rights for      | Separation of privilege     |
|                                | read file2; Eve cannot read    | subjects (users) to objects    |                             |

| Linux Access Control           | Alice can write the file; Bob  | Uses file permissions to       | Simplicity and uniformity   |
|                                | cannot write the file; Eve     | control read/write/execute     |                             |

| Principle of Least Privilege   | Alice can perform write        | Users are given minimum levels | Minimize potential damage   |
